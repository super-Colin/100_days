The idea of this is basically to code for as many days as possible, 100 days if I can and if I manage that then I'll try to code all 365 days of 2020

Wish me luck :)





Things to learn/research if I can't think of something else:

REST API

https://codepen.io/bosworthco/details/RjBvgw/

interacting with a db in python and PHP
    Postgresql vs MongoDB


Look into:

Datomic, elm / elm-ui
Web Assembly
vue.js / react
typescript
node.js


Clojure -- Pedestal(very functional)
