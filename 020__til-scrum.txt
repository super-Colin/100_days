Biggest Take-aways:

    Lots of sprints, lots of reviews, lots of incremented deliverables


    "Definition of Done: a shared understanding of expectations that the Increment must live up to in order to be releasable into production. Managed by the Development Team."
    

    "All events are time-boxed. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened."


    The Development Team is not jsut devs, it includes designers, marketing specialists etc. whoever is needed to make the team non-dependant on others
        
        "Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team"
